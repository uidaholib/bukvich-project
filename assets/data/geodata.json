Larson and the comissioning board opted for simple percussion that could be performed by any band program in the state of Montana; therefore, no mallet percussion was utilized for this piece. In planning this piece, Larson wanted to get the All State Band to rehearse the piece at the Buffalo Jump site, but \"the band world isn't cool enough to figure out how to make that happen,\" according to Bukvich. Since its original premiere at MMEA 2000, it recieves an estimated hundereds of performances a year.",

At the same time, Bukvich's student, Liam Marchant, noticed some of the harmonic similiarities between \"Giant Steps\" and the bridge to \"Have You Met Miss Jones?\" in Bukvich's Jazz Theory class. The bridge of this piece is the bridge of \"Have You Met Miss Jones?\"",
